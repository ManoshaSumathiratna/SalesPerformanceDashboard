Based on the analysis, the reasons for the sales drop were identified and recomendations discussed to overcome the issue.

<b> Figure 1: Netflix Qualrterly Revenue by Year </b>

<br/>

This indicates the quarterly revenue of Netflix from 2017 to 2022. This in-depth analysis helps Netflix in realising that, despite an increase in annual sales in 2022, the company's revenue actually declined in the final two quarters of that year.
<br/>

<b> Figure 2: Netflix Quarterly Revenue Growth% </b>
<br/>

<br/>

Figure 2 makes it evident that Netflix's revenue growth has slowed down over the years. It displays negative revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, raising concerns about Netflix's business life cycle's maturity. The aforementioned figure can be tracked by Netflix for the upcoming quarters, and if it keeps falling, Netflix should think about expanding into new product or market segments.

<b> Figure 3: Regional Contribution to Annual Revenue (2017 - 2022)</b>
<br/>

<br/>

As per Figure 3, the management of Netflix can monitor the geographical contribution to Netflix's annual revenue from Figure 4.2.5. The stacked bar chart shows that the US and Canada region's share of total income is steadily declining from 59% to 45% between 2017 and 2022. For the years 2017 to 2022, the EMEA region's contribution to Netflix's annual revenue has climbed from 21% to 31%. Netflix should therefore think about providing EMEA subscribers with more appealing and attractive TV shows, movies and other programs.
