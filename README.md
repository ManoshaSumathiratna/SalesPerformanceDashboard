<h2> Data Analysis and Justification </h2>
<b> Figure 1: Netflix Qualrterly Revenue by Year </b>

<br/>
<p align="justify">
This indicates the quarterly revenue of Netflix from 2017 to 2022. This in-depth analysis helps Netflix in realising that, despite an increase in annual sales in 2022, the company's revenue actually declined in the final two quarters of that year.
<br/>

<b> Figure 2: Netflix Quarterly Revenue Growth% </b>

<br/>
<p align="justify">
Figure 2 makes it evident that Netflix's revenue growth has slowed down over the years. It displays negative revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, raising concerns about Netflix's business life cycle's maturity. The aforementioned figure can be tracked by Netflix for the upcoming quarters, and if it keeps falling, Netflix should think about expanding into new product or market segments.

<b> Figure 3: Regional Contribution to Annual Revenue (2017 - 2022)</b>

<br/>
<p align="justify">
As per Figure 3, the management of Netflix can monitor the geographical contribution to Netflix's annual revenue from Figure 4.2.5. The stacked bar chart shows that the US and Canada region's share of total income is steadily declining from 59% to 45% between 2017 and 2022. For the years 2017 to 2022, the EMEA region's contribution to Netflix's annual revenue has climbed from 21% to 31%. Netflix should therefore think about providing EMEA subscribers with more appealing and attractive TV shows, movies and other programs.

<br/>
<p align="justify">
According to the Donut chart in Figure 4, Netflix is experiencing slow growth in new subscriptions since past two years. Year 2020 was the highest number of subscriptions recorded, followed by 2018 and 2019.  This may be an indication that Netflix’s market is getting saturated. Therefore, it is necessary to clearly identify which regions have the potential for future growth.

<br/>
<p align="justify">
Figure 5 can be used by Netflix to discover the region wise new subscriptions for the period 2017 to 2022. As per the below bar chart, new subscriptions have been continuously decreasing for all regions since last two years. The most significant finding is that the US and Canada recorded a negative number of new memberships in 2022, indicating that Netflix lost over one million subscribers during the previous year.

<h2> Conclusion & Recommendation </h2>
<p align="justify">
Despite being a giant player in the streaming market, Netflix has recently seen some revenue and subscription declines. The dashboard created utilising Netflix's data serves to highlight the gravity of this problem and makes obvious which regions and when the company lost revenue and subscribers.

<p align="justify">
According to the dashboard's conclusions for the years 2017 to 2022, Netflix may want to take some measures to stop revenue decline and subscriber loss. Netflix could track the revenue growth for the upcoming quarters from the dashboard, and if it continuous to decline, it should think about expanding into new product or market segments. Additionally, given that the EMEA region has the most subscribers, Netflix should consider providing EMEA subscribers with more appealing and attractive TV shows, movies and other programs. In addition, dashboard data indicates that, despite a diminishing trend in subscriber growth across all four regions, the Asia-Pacific region may still have space for development. As a result, by focusing on emerging markets, Netflix can invest more in regional content in the Asia-Pacific area, such as top Japanese series, exclusive Korean dramas, and popular Bollywood films. Over the past few years, the number of new members from the US and Canada region has decreased, indicating that this region's market has reached saturation. However, according to the dashboard, the US and Canada region remains to receive the highest amount of income per membership. Hence, Netflix should focus on keeping its present clientele and ensuring a low churn rate in this market because the US and Canadian markets' membership withdrawals are significantly impacting the company's revenue.   
The proposed Power BI dashboard would assist Netflix in keeping track of its data in future too and the management of Netflix can use the insights to formulate strategies and make informed business decisions.
